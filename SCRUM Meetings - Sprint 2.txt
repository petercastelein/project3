What have we accomplished since our last meeting?
- Kyle: configured add order button
- Ethan: put in all the plus buttons for every single menu item, sorted out menu images for every item
- Peter: Worked on processing in the back-end, redoing ordering code from previous project

Blockers:
- Kyle: figuring out how to incorporate price into sales button
- Connecting the front-end with the database, currently does as much as it can without interacting
- Relative inexperience with Node, always having to learn things from scratch.

Taskers going forward:
- Ivan: catch up with all the technical stuff, look into Google Translate integration, upload documents to Discord
- Kyle: focusing on 313, will work where he can
- Peter: Work on more back-end connectivity with the database, picking up Order object and sending it to the database.
- Ethan: add back-end connectivity to order submission

Notes:
- We're going to make a word doc instead of a PPT for the team meeting.
- We're gonna meet tomorrow night on Discord to do a run-through of our presentation.
- We've updated our Monday to account for the removal of automated tasks switching.
- Created product backlog for this sprint:

- Have basic manager GUI.
- Full functionality to submit orders from the User and Cashier interface with the back-end.
- Integrate Google Translate fully into our GUI.
